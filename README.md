# sentiment-reviewer

I trained this network largely using scikit-learn libraries and visualized my training using seaborn graph helpers.

I used this dataset with 10,000 yelp reviews and classified them based on these 10 entries

**business_id** (ID of the business being reviewed)
**date** (Day the review was posted)
**review_id** (ID for the posted review)
**stars** (1?5 rating for the business)
**text** (Review text)
**type** (Type of text)
**user_id** (User?s id)
{**cool** / **useful** / **funny**} (Comments on the review, given by other users)
